# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## Overview

Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

Uses the Inquirer package.

Uses the Jest package for a suite of unit tests.

The application must have Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern classes


Your application should use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```
node index.js
```

Team Details:
team manager
name
employee ID
email address
office number

engineer
name, 
ID, 
email
GitHub username

intern
name
ID
school
email

## Application Functionality
The following image shows a mock-up of the generated HTML’s appearance and functionality:

The application must include `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` classes. The tests for these classes (in the `_tests_` directory) must ALL pass.
